% Insert bibliography entries in BibTex or BibLaTeX format
%   See ../example/ref.bib
% Don't hurt yourself. Unless your sources are super old or non-public, 
%   you can generate the entries automatically without need to look up any 
%   details. 
%   
%   Good tools for that are e.g. 
%     - zbib.org ... add all your entries -> Export -> Download BibTeX -> (copy%         downloaded file here)
%     - scholar.google.com ... there is "Cite" button available in search 
%         results -> BibTeX -> (paste here)
%     - citace.com ... If you have PRO version, there's button "Stáhnout 
%         označené citace" -> (paste the file here)
%     - ScienceDirect ... button "Cite" -> Export citation to 
%         BibTeX -> (paste here)
%     - others ... there should be some "Cite" button... If not, use 
%         "Manual entry" in zbib.org or create entry right here according to 
%         https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types/
